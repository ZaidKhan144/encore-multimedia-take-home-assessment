# Encore Multimedia Take Home Assessment

Create a responsive landing page.

## Task Details
 
We invite you to develop a mock landing page, using the three PSD mockups attached.
The requirements for it are as follows:

- Fully responsive (100% fluid), not adaptive (snapping between fixed-width sizes)
- 2x Retina support
- HTML based, no PHP or anything server-side (with 1 exception)
- Banner text should be in actual HTML, not image based
-Icons should be inside of an image sprite for performance (or use SVGs)
- Mobile-First CSS
- Avoid using a CSS framework
- The live site's form in reality will be submitting an AJAX POST request to a university form system. For this assessment, create a dummy "response" PHP script that will <strong>post back the submitted variables in the place of the form without refreshing the page</strong>. Use AJAX system to accomplish this. Also, use the script to accomplish the following:
  - Include client-side validation
  - Validate proper email format <strong>name@domain.TLD</strong>
  - Force the phone number field's format to be <strong>(###) ###-####</strong>
- Use the Picture element or <strong>srcset</strong> attributes on photos when applicable for performance
- Site should function well in IE11+
- You do not have a mobile or tablet design for the videos section. Come up with your own mobile/tablet styling for them, and suggest and implement a cross-browser compatible and attractive way to view the videos
- Make the compiled version of the site production-ready and as performant as possible on every device/size/screen density without sacrificing quality. Test download size and requests with Chrome's developer tools.
- Deliverables are: your whole project folder, and the compiled version of the site.
- There is a .zip file in the "Files" section that contains artwork
- Feel free to ask questions. We don't work inside of caves, so questions are expected on functionality and how things should work.
